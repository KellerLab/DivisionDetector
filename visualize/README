# Visualizing Ground Truth in MaMuT

Step 1: Use BigDataViewer plugin to open KLB file and save as XML 
 - In Fiji, go to Plugins -> Big Data Viewer -> Open KLB
 - Select the last time step of the data to use as a template
(For me, this only worked for the original file, not a symlink)
 - Manually specify pixel spacing to reflect the voxel size (for mouse embryo data, set z to 5)
 - Save XML in this visualization folder (referencing it elsewhere may not work)

Step 1.5: Gather Ground Truth in JSON or txt Format

JSON
 - JSON files must follow oen of the two structures below, and contain points from a single time frame:

{ "divisions": {
	<id>: {
		"center": [<z>, <y>, <x>]
		}
	},
	...
}

OR

{ "divisions": [
	{"center": [<z>, <y>, <x>]},
	... ]
}

TXT
 - Text files should have one point per line, coordinates within a line should be tab separated,
and coordinates should appear in the order (t, z, y, x)
 - If all points in a file are from the same time frame, the time coordinate can be omitted from the file.

Step 2 (Optional, kind of): Write script that gathers data from desired sources
 - The file mamut_point_writer.py contains the infrastructure for addings points from files and writing
 the xml. If you have a simple case, like a single text or json file, you can run mamut_point_writer.py
 as a script. Run the file with no arguments to see the help describing the arguments.
 - If your case is more complex, you can write a script that creates a MamutPointWriter,
 adds points from files using add_points_from_json() or add_points_from_text(), and writes the xml using
 write_to_file()

 Step 3: Run the script to generate the xml

Step 4: Load into MaMuT
 - In Fiji, go to Plugins -> MaMuT -> Open MaMuT Annotation
 - Navigate to the output XML created by your script and open it
 - (Optional) Tell it not to display tracks and limit drawing depth to 20 pixels, and
set color by quality. You can also change the spot display radius if the spot drawings
are covering up the image.
 - Open the MaMuT Viewer
 - Scroll along the bottom to the target frame, and then navigate around the image to find
your points (press F1 for help). If you sort by quality, points in each file (or group,
if you customized the script) will be displayed in a different color.
